**Assignment 2 - Classification and Clustering**

This assignment focuses on the implementation of the K-means clustering and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification algorithms.

## Usage

Open the `.ipynb` files using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) to run the progams.

```bash
jupyter-notebook k_means.ipynb
```

```bash
jupyter-notebook knn.ipynb
```

The `k_means.ipynb` file makes use of the following packages:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [scikit-learn (sklearn)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

The `knn.ipynb` file makes use of the following packages:
